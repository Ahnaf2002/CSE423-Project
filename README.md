# CSE423-Project
A Python game using OpenGL to care for a virtual pet.
## Features

### 1. **Interactive Virtual Pet**
- A cat character is the main focus of the game.
- Players must manage the cat's health, hunger, energy, and happiness.

### 2. **Day and Night Cycle**
- The game simulates a day-night cycle.
- During the daytime, the pet can eat, play, and perform activities.
- During the nighttime, the cat must sleep to regain energy.

### 3. **Health and Status Indicators**
- Hunger, energy, and health are tracked through status indicators.
- Hunger increases every 6 seconds, and if left unchecked, it decreases health.
- Players must feed the cat and ensure it sleeps to maintain health and happiness.

### 4. **Mini-Games**
#### Fishing Game:
- Players can engage in a fishing game to catch fish and earn points.
- Fish appear at random positions, and the player must move the cat to catch them.

#### Ball Game:
- The cat plays with a soccer ball, aiming to score goals.
- Points are awarded for every successful goal scored.

### 5. **Fireworks Display**
- Players can trigger fireworks by right-clicking the mouse.
- Fireworks add visual flair and entertain the cat.

### 6. **Interactive Gameplay**
- The cat interacts with objects such as the food pan and bed.
- Clicking on the food pan allows the cat to eat.
- Moving the cat to the bed and clicking puts it to sleep.

### 7. **Real-Time Feedback**
- The game provides real-time feedback through messages and animations.
- Warnings are shown if the cat is unhappy or needs attention (e.g., food or sleep).

### 8. **Simple Controls**
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the cat (left, right, or jump).
- **Mouse Clicks**:
  - Left-click: Interact with objects (food pan, bed, etc.).
  - Right-click: Launch fireworks.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: Move the ball during the ball game.
  - `Space`: Start/stop gameplay.
